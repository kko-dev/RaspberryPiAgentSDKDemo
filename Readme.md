# TeamViewer instant support integration
This demo code integrates the [TeamViewer Agent Api](https://github.com/teamviewer/iotagentsdk) into a demonstration, 
showing the instant support functionality management just with hardware elements.
This demo shows an use case, where the management of the TeamViewer support capabilites is controlled via hardware elements.
It is possible to create a [service case](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/features/service-queue/) and manage incoming connection.
The user has the possiblity to press two buttons to either allow or reject the incoming connection.
The red LED's are indicating running TeamViewer session. For every open connection, one LED is light up. For this demo only two participents are supported.
The last functionlity is a button, which will terminate all ongoing sessions.
